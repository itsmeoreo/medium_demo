      intro: "Having a beautiful face is hot but having a kind soul is hotter. Having a banging body is hot but having a brilliant brain is hotter. Having external success is hot but having internal fulfillment is hotter.\n\nYou see, it’s not all about what meets the eye, but the treasure that lies within. I have been guilty of judging a book by its cover. People by their appearances. But like they say you can meet people only as deeply as you have met yourself. So, after a bit of soul-searching, these are the 5 things that instantly turn me on in a person",
      "1.Empathy & Compassion": "The most attractive people are kind even when the world has been unkind to them. The most attractive people are generous, even when they have little to give. The most attractive people have an open heart, even when they have every reason to close their hearts.\n\nIt tells you a lot about a person when they help someone who has nothing to give back. Helping a stranger with directions. Helping a homeless person with a meal. Helping a friend with the move. Helping a family member with a listening ear. These little things make a big difference and it’s simply so attractive.",
      "2.Intellectual Curiosity": "Someone who can silence their ego and open their mind is hot. Someone who is genuinely interested in learning more about you, your passions, your dreams, your desires, and your goals is hot. Someone who eagerly seeks new experiences, new connections, and new adventures is hot.\n\nMy favorite thing about curiosity is that it can be practiced by anyone but an insecure person can never be truly curious.",
      "3.Having Boundaries": "People who are kind but have no boundaries are not kind. They are just people-pleasers who are constantly seeking validation and most of the time have a hidden motive.\n\nThe most attractive people have standards, they have boundaries, and they are not afraid to say no.\n\nYou know what’s attractive? Saying no to opportunities that don’t align with your values.\nYou know what’s attractive? Saying no to unhealthy relationships that suck the soul out of you.\nYou know what’s attractive? Saying no to yourself. No to your temptations. No to your excuses. No to your self-doubt that’s silently robbing you of the beautiful life you deserve.",
      "4.Living with Passion and Purpose": "People with purpose move differently. You can see commitment in their eyes, discipline in their action, and conviction in their voice. When you come across such people, you are instantly drawn to them. Their energy is so magnetic that it lights up your own ambitions and aspirations. It leaves you with a sense of hope and assurance, almost whispering, “You’ve got this too.”",
      "5.A sense of Humor": "You know that kind of person, right? The one who doesn’t take themselves too seriously. The one that can make you laugh until your stomach hurts. The one who’s laugh is funnier than the joke itself.\n\nThis type of people is rare and they understand that tragedy is the biggest comedy. Your guard naturally comes down, and you’re transported back to that childlike state. You don’t need to play the pretend game anymore. It’s like they’ve given you permission to be yourself. It’s like they accept you with all your flaws. This sense of comfort and acceptance is attractive af.",

      postedDate: new Date("2023-12-25T04:34:00"),
      subTopics: ["1.Run Your Own Race","2. Embrace Your Sadness", "3. Avoid Half-Heartedness", "4. Be an Asker", "5. Commit"],
      "1.Run Your Own Race": "The easiest way to win the race of your life is to focus on your own race. Set goals for yourself and focus on reaching them. When you reach them, you feel proud. When you don’t, push yourself to do better. Don’t measure yourself based on what other people are doing. Just focus on running your own race, and most importantly, at your own pace.",
      "2. Embrace Your Sadness": "Sadness can be overwhelming and all-consuming. But sometimes, these are the most important moments. In these moments, you find yourself being shaken loose from the grip of your despair, and you are gifted the opportunity to take a deep breath, watch the emotions pass through you, and be reminded of the true nature of things. It is these moments that can help you to find a new perspective and remember that you are never truly alone.",
      "3. Avoid Half-Heartedness": "If you allow too much half-heartedness, it may be because you yourself are half-hearted. This could be due to anxiety and ambivalence, or a need for reassurance. It could also be due to boredom, or a lack of clarity about your own feelings and opinions. You may not have anything in your life that truly anchors you to yourself; you may lack conviction about what you love, so you’re looking for someone else to provide that certainty. So, you accept breadcrumbs from anyone who is willing to give them. But when your heart is full, everything you do will come from a place of love. You have an abundance of potential within you. Pay attention to it.",
      "4. Be an Asker": "Firstly, stop punishing yourself for expressing your needs. Many people are kind and will accommodate you, but some may not, and that’s okay too! If you don’t ask, the answer will always be no. People who don’t ask for what they want often end up feeling resentful of themselves and the world. Directness is a gateway drug to emotional honesty. Give it a try.",
      "5. Commit": "Living in the “Infinite Browsing Culture” can give you an illusion of endless options for every choice you make, whether it’s the content you consume, romantic partners, jobs, side gigs, or creative projects. It’s easy to feel like you never want to commit to any one identity, place, or community. But when you take a step back and think about the things that you truly admire, respect, and remember, it’s usually not the institutions and people who come from the Culture of Open Options.\n\nYou keep swiping through potential partners, but when you come across a story online about an elderly couple celebrating their seventieth anniversary, you can’t help but be touched by their dedication and commitment to each other. In your own life, you may find yourself uprooting often, but you still find yourself lining up to get into those famous corner pizza joints and legendary diners that have been around for fifty years. It’s clear that, deep down, you appreciate and value the things that have stood the test of time and have proven their worth through commitment and consistency.",
      conclution: "Thank you for taking the time to read this. I have committed to a personal challenge of writing 30 essays in 30 days, and this is my very first attempt. I hope to use this opportunity to explore the concept of self-improvement and share my findings with my readers. I am excited to embark on this journey, and I invite you to come along with me.",

      storyTopic: "How to Set Realistic Goals for 2024.",
      postedDate: new Date("2023-12-22T10:22:00"),
      subTopics: ["1. Setting goals is different from setting realistic goals.","2. Write the goals down, and attach the deadlines (if any).", "3. Work towards your goals.", "4. Ask for help.", "5. Try Other Things.", "6. Reflect on your goals.", "7. Relax"],
      intro: "2023 was an absolute experience for me. With incredible highs and a lot of lows. Personally, 2023 came with so many challenges, especially when we got to the second half of it. I have cried more, loved more, laughed more, and lived more. To be honest, this year has been a rollercoaster of every type of emotion available. Life was dishing it to me as it fit.\n\nStarting the year, I had so many goals that I wanted to achieve for the year. I didn’t start achieving any of the goals until the second half of the year. The only thing I had going for me was consistency, consistency in the things I did. It was like, life was agreeing with me — I was simultaneously doing the things I wanted to do even though I didn’t succeed at all. I just kept trying.\n\nOut of all the goals I set for the year, I wasn’t able to achieve two of them. And the most unrealistic goal I had on my list was to save money. As much as I wanted to save, 2023 wasn’t the year for me. I had other goals that involved me spending a lot of money throughout the year, and there was no room to save even a little. Yet, I had savings as part of my 2023 goals. The other goal I wanted didn’t depend solely on me to carry out, so I don’t think that counts.\n\nYou can see how unrealistic that was. Towards the end of the year, I decided to write about how to set realistic goals for the year. I will be applying this in my next year’s goal-setting plan, and I hope that you do too.\n\nSettling realistic goals is important, you are not only going to see yourself achieving your goals, you will also feel a sense of achievement as the months go by. You have something to look at by the end of the year and say that you have done well. Fulfilling one goal in a year is better than having 10 unfulfilled goals, trust me.\n\nSetting realistic goals means your goals should align, I was setting goals about saving when I had plans to use money throughout the year. My goals don’t align, neither were they realistic. Let’s get to it:",
      "1. Setting goals is different from setting realistic goals.": "As I said, I didn’t need to add savings to my goals in 2023 but I did. Because I wanted my list to look “serious”. Now, I understand that not saving this year doesn’t mean I was bad with my finances. I needed a new apartment, and that comes with its expenses. I needed a new laptop, and a whole lot of things that I wouldn’t need to mention.\n\nAnd since I was working with the money I was getting, and wasn’t expecting anything extra– I should have been more realistic with my goals. So, set realistic goals, goals you can achieve, healthy amounts of goals, and do not overwhelm yourself–else you are already confused about where to start before you begin. Set two goals if you have only two in mind, you don’t have to create a goal just to elongate the list. You can always add more goals later in the year.",
      "2. Write the goals down, and attach the deadlines (if any).": "Not attaching deadlines to your goals reduces the pressure on you to achieve a goal. Always add an estimated deadline for your goal, and if you don’t get to do it before the time, you can always extend the deadline a little bit more. Don’t get lazy because you feel you can always extend deadlines, you are only slowing down the number of goals you can achieve. That’s why you need to learn self-discipline.",
      "3. Work towards your goals.": "Put in place things that will make you achieve these goals, and set aside discipline to achieve these goals. Create a life for your goals. Goals are meant to change your life and improve them for the better. You need to also live accordingly, by preparing yourself for your goals. Note that, you won’t start achieving goals immediately. Keep in mind that these goals will take time to happen.",
      "4. Ask for help.": "Who says because they are your goals you have to do them alone? Always be open to asking for help from those who can help you. It will not only make it easier for you, but it will also improve your resilience to do better.",
      "5. Try Other Things.": "The fact that you set the goals doesn’t mean you can’t do other things. Some people set goals and forget them, or forget to do other things and focus only on their goals. You can come across opportunities that are good for you, grab the opportunity as it comes. You may decide that they do not look your goals so there is no need to. Kindly seize the opportunities that come your way, you may never know.",
      "6. Reflect on your goals.": "Always go back to the drawing board, tick your goals, re-strategize, and remind yourself why you want to do that from the beginning. Break your goals into subgoals. Some goals depend on a lot of actions before they are finally complete. So that a goal won’t look like it’s taking so much of your time, you can have sub-goals for this goal and tick them as achieved until you get to achieve your goal. This way, you see progress as you work.",
      "7. Relax": "You can always push goals to the following year. If you have done all these, and have goals left when the year is already running out. Take a deep breath, look at all you have achieved during the year, pat yourself on the back, and push the leftover goals to the following year.",
      conclution: "If you like my articles and they have helped you in anyway. Give me a tip. Leave a comment about your goal-setting plans, and what has worked for you. I would love to learn from my amazing readers. Leave claps, add to your list, and share with your friends. Have a happy new year!!",

      storyTopic: "Self-Acceptance: Sitting with yourself",
      postedDate: new Date("2023-12-24T09:12:00"),
      intro: "Self-acceptance is understanding the reality of oneself and knowing who you are, in every aspect, yet desiring improvement for yourself.",
      subject: ["Lately, It’s been hard to find oneself or should I say, “Know oneself”. The feeling where you are doing so much yet you don’t understand what exactly you are doing. Questions like, What am I doing? Why am I doing this? Am I enjoying this? Is this for me? I could go on and on because I have been there, I am there.",
      "Understanding the way self-acceptance works requires you to sit with yourself and ask yourself these questions. Let it flow, you are talking to yourself, and that’s one person you don’t lie to. Be sincere with yourself, breathe, write it down, and read it, now you have your answer.",
      "And on days when you sit with yourself and still can’t find the answers, I want you to know that you are not alone. There are times when I feel like that, but then, it’s not every time you like to talk to people right? Same thing with your mind, it’s not every time it communicates with you. You will have to try again. In a different environment, way, or setting.",
      "True self-acceptance shows up at that moment when you realize that you need to stop being your enemy. By lying to yourself, you are your enemy.",
      "Self-esteem means we value who we are and we see ourselves as valuable regardless of any areas we want to change. Self-acceptance is the ability to embrace all aspects of ourselves; not only the more “positive, esteem-able” parts, but every part.",
      "Self-acceptance is the key to having positive self-esteem and mastering confidence. It is also important to grow and succeed in all aspects of our lives. To do that, we need to accept ourselves, what we see in the mirror, the reflection of our minds and body.",
      "Self-acceptance is so important, it’s you touching reality and working with it to attain your goals, understand yourself, know what you want, improve yourself, and live.",
      "Everyone is unique and deserving of self-acceptance. Being kind and compassionate towards yourself is the way to build confidence. It doesn’t matter what anyone else says or has said. You are worthy. The main thing that matters is that you provide that love to yourself.",
      "Are you ready to sit with yourself? To understand who you are, all that you are.",

      storyTopic: "Humanness in remote design culture",
      postedDate: new Date("2023-04-30T09:12:00"),
      intro: "What I learned from a year of fostering a virtual design community\n\nBy Katie Garrison",
      subject: ["A good design culture can make you feel productive. A great design culture can make you feel a sense of belonging at work. It attracts new, creative talent and has huge effects on employee retention, happiness, and productivity. It’s more than pep-talk posters hung on pretty corporate walls, it’s humanness.",
      "Through my myriad of work experience, having once been a shoe salesperson, a barista at a vegan coffee shop, a waiter at an Italian restaurant, a visual designer at an innovation practice, and now a Senior Product Designer at Xbox, I’ve dealt with many types of work cultures — for better or for worse.",
      "Managers look to ensure their teams are productive, but I believe productivity comes from a sense of belonging and purpose. Given the number of recent mass layoffs across tech, human connection is paramount right now. From my experience, here are some tried and true suggestions for how to activate humanness within your design culture.",
      "Make space for good vibes & collaboration",
      "I once thrived on creative, in-person collaboration with my design co-workers, so going virtual in 2020 made me feel disconnected from my work community.",
      "How could I have innovative, serendipitous brainstorming sessions that led to a sense of connection? As designers, we work in a world where imagination, planning, and critical thinking are the tools we need to do our jobs, but the inspiration that fuses them together is like a fiery hand shaking one of water. How do we recreate that — remotely? I reached a point where I was driven to create more opportunities for organic behavior between my remote co-workers. The first step was research gathering. I took it upon myself to reach out to peers and ask how being newly remote affected them.",
      "Here’s how employees responded to going remote so suddenly:",
      '“I feel like I’m working in a silo.”',
      '“My manager knows what I’m doing, but does anyone else?”',
      '“New employees and new voices aren’t usually recognized while established employees dominate meetings.”',
      "This told me I wasn’t alone in how I was feeling, it was simply a side effect of suddenly going remote. From that, I started Design Co-Op, an internal Teams channel or an opt-in sync for all Xbox designers to share work, retro our week, and connect every Friday morning. Run by and made for individual contributors and non-managers, the channel is designed to grow and evolve with our needs.",
      "We simply jump into our Teams video chat and open our FigJam to simultaneously contribute to the Weekly Retro. The host — which rotates based on availability — starts an 8-minute timer and background music. Did I mention these features are already integrated into FigJam? *Chef’s kiss*. During these 8 minutes, we fill out the question of the week, what went well, and what could’ve gone better with sticky notes.",
      "Friday Retros gives us time to reflect on the week we’ve had at work (or in our personal lives). Afterward, we can opt to verbally chat about what we wrote to self-promote and to promote others or discuss what could have gone better and how. It’s a great way to wrap up our week while getting to know each other organically.",
      "The second half of Design Co-op is space for designers to brainstorm UX for a project they’re working on or simply a top-of-mind conversation topic. These items widely vary and are highly encouraged so it remains a flexible space.",
      "Measuring good vibes in work culture is tricky. But I had a few things in mind that determined the success of Design Co-op — how many people showed up to Design Co-op per session? How many of those people actually interacted with others (whether verbally or in text chat), along with continuous feedback of what folks were getting out of Design Co-op?",
      "How it’s going:",
      '“Design Co-op is a safe space to share and collaborate my ideas with team members I may not have the chance to interact with formally. It creates a unique space for innovative ideas to develop and unexpected relationships to form.”',
      '“[Design Co-op] has made it easy and natural to get to know everyone on a more personal level. It helps me understand who is on what team, knowing who to go to for feedback, and connecting everyone from various teams — building a solid design community.”',
      '“Simple things matter tons. [Design Co-op] is a space where you feel heard and matter.”',
      "Culture is what produces our products and leads to more innovation. I’m proud of this space that we’ve created because we can’t empower the world if we’re not empowered ourselves.",
      "Leverage async communication channels",
      "People need time to focus or process information at their own pace. So, it’s vital to have channels for asynchronous connection and innovation for employees to tap into when it’s convenient for them. Junior and seasoned employees alike can plug in and collaborate seamlessly in apps like Teams. To help foster a vibrant remote culture, managers should incentivize workers to use those channels and make them part of the onboarding process. Async channels are also a great place to self-promote (Hey! I shipped this thing.) and uplift others (Whoa! They shipped that thing.) for more visibility across the org. I’m excited to see how we’ll continue to evolve and improve Design Co-op as it matures.",
      "for me, creating additional space to share and celebrate together was a simple and effective step toward elevating humanness at work — and I know others reading this have taken steps of their own.",
      "What’s worked for you to bring more humanness to a remote design culture?",
